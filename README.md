# open-source-alternative-redirector
Fork of [open-source-alternative-redirector](https://github.com/forLoop42/open-source-alternative-redirector).

A userscript for redirecting your browser from commercial platforms to open source proxies.

It's not a technical git fork because the GitHub repo doesn't seem up to date versus the version you find on [greasyfork.org](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/437291-open-source-alternative-redirector), see [this issue](https://github.com/forLoop42/open-source-alternative-redirector/issues/9).

The code changes are just for another tiktok proxy instance and I disabled some redirects I don't want. I basically only want it for tiktok because friends keep sending me tiktok links and the website is absolutely horrible and I refuse to install the app (not because it's chinese, but I consider it addictive mental junk food and I already waste enough of my life with looking at screens).
