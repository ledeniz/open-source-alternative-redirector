# open-source-alternative-redirector
Fork of [open-source-alternative-redirector](https://github.com/forLoop42/open-source-alternative-redirector)a userscript for redirecting your browser from commercial platforms to open source proxies.

It's not a technical git fork because the GitHub repo doesn't seem up to date versus the version you find on [greasyfork.org](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/437291-open-source-alternative-redirector), see [this issue](https://github.com/forLoop42/open-source-alternative-redirector/issues/9).

The code changes are just for another tiktok proxy instance and I disabled some redirects I don't want.
